Wake up with sore waist and aching back this morning, it is pretty obvious that surfing is killing me yesterday. However, the NT 1350 is absolutely a great price for the memory, especially with colleagues in my summer internship!

Given a ride by Japanese, all of us are pretty nervous while keep check out the routes ourselves, but it was pretty brave of him to take us safely lol. Since freeway No.5 is too crowded, we take the mountain road passing Ping-Xi and get to north coast.

傑夫 suring shop is really a nice place. The cute doggies & friendly host, Mao-Sao, welcomed us. After watching a long long long video, we finally get to Wushi Port (Because the closest port near the shop, honeymoon bay, didn't owned big wave then). Lied on the surfing board to my stomach, practiced the stupid-looking surfing actions, we eventually get our extremely heave board down to ocean!! Pushed by personal coach for the first two hours, I get to be familiar with standing up on board (only success for roughly two times QQ). The most exhausting thing is not surfing itself but to grab the board andfight with waves to walk to deeper ocean, so we always want to wait for the good wave then surf. BTW, The delicious Fu-long lunchbox and funny titan rest time fulfills exhausted heart & body.

For the rest 1.5-hour teaching time, coach only look for the good time for us and asking us to climb up board, thrash, feel the pushing power from wave and jump on our own. My big problem is *not thrashing thoroughly*, resulting in weak initial speed which shorten my possible surfing length & stability for standing up. To thrash thoroughly means using the forearm to push deep water away, not just on the surface. **(Like boating!)**

The most challenging time is to find the good chance by myself. A bad time can make me crash and toss in water, harshly afraid of drowning. However, I still try my best to catch every possible good white spray, which is a good practice for newbie. After drinking a lot tons of salty water, I finally get to stand up surfing without help from anyone! (but only once lol) At the end, I even lose the energy to stand up from board, so it's time for dinner. With no energe left, sliding on the board til shore is pretty awesome but look stupid when four of us doing it together XDD, as if we were seal!

Although some brusing back were brought back, it was still memorable experience that I would absolutely wanna get back again!
